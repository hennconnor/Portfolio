                    Hi, my name is Connor. I am a full stack software engineer looking to get into the professional world of coding.
                    I am well-versed in JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails, HTML and CSS.
                    Currently, I am working on projects to further develop my skills, as well as learning C++.
                    In my free time, I enjoy making music, socializing and going to the gym.
