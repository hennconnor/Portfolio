                    I am a full stack software engineer well-versed in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next, Ruby, Rails, HTML and CSS.
                    Currently, I am working as contract engineer, while coding on the side to further develop my skills.
                    In my free time, I enjoy making music, socializing and going to the gym.
