                    Hello, my name is Connor. I'm a full stack software engineer from Seattle, WA.
                    I am experienced with JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails, HTML and CSS.
                    Past experiences, pre-coding include experience working in Banking as well as the Hospitality sector.
                    In my free time, I enjoy making music, socializing and going to the gym.
                    I love how coding feels like a never ending journey, with always a new mountain or obstacle to overcome.
                    I find the process of everyday surpassing new challenges incredibly rewarding.
                    I look forward to the future challenges and opportunities of growth this field will present and feel excited about both contributing to a new company, as well as my future personal development.
